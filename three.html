<h1>My Favorite People</h1>
<p> This project means the most to me because it involves the three most important people in my life. It gives me all the hope and joy for them to be in my life. Sometimes things get rocky, but they keep me going and I am so very grateful to have them in my life and on this journey, so here's a little tribute to them. 
</p>
<ul> 
      <li>Zion is my son he is everything to me, he gave me a new meaning to life and most importantly the gift of motherhood. I gave birth to him last year and he changed my life forever. There's no better feeling in this world than being a mother and watching him grow everyday. He's so smart and cute! Where would I be without him? </li>
      <li>Tim is my boyfriend we met in May, but it feels like forever since we've known each other we share great passion and he's a diligent young man striving for things hoped for. I couldn't be more proud of him!</li>
      <li>Taco is my godson, he came into my life while I was pregnant with Zion and he's such the sweetest pup ever he brngs true joy and smiles.</li>
</ul>
